# Add two numbers

### Link
https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6V
Output: [1,2]
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```

### Constrains
- The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
- 0 <= Node.val <= 9
- It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.
